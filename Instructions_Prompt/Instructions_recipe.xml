  "recipe_name": "Poha with Stuffed Potato",
  "categories": ["Indian", "Breakfast", "Vegetarian"],
  "ingredients": "1 cup Poha (flattened rice), 2 medium Potatoes, 1/2 cup Peas, 1 Onion (finely chopped), 1 Green Chilli (chopped), 1/2 tsp Mustard Seeds, 1/2 tsp Cumin Seeds, 1/4 tsp Turmeric Powder, 1/2 tsp Red Chilli Powder, 1/2 tsp Garam Masala, Salt to taste, Coriander leaves for garnishing, Lemon wedges for serving, Oil for cooking.",
  "instructions": "Step 1 – Prepping the Potatoes: Boil the potatoes until fork-tender. Let them cool, then peel and mash. Add salt, red chilli powder, and garam masala to the mashed potatoes. Mix well and keep aside. Step 2 – Preparing the Poha: Rinse the poha in a sieve under running water for a few seconds. Let it sit for about 10 minutes to soften. Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Let them splutter. Add chopped onions and green chilli. Saute until onions turn translucent. Add peas and turmeric powder. Cook for a few minutes. Add the softened poha, salt, and mix well. Cook for 5–7 minutes on low heat. Step 3 – Stuffing the Potatoes: Take a portion of the mashed potato mixture and shape it into small balls. Make an indentation in each ball and stuff it with the poha mixture. Step 4 – Final Touch: Heat oil in a pan, place the stuffed potato balls, and cook until golden brown on all sides. Step 5 – Serving: Serve hot, garnished with fresh coriander leaves and lemon wedges on the side.",
  "tips": "Avoid over-soaking the poha—just rinse and rest for 10 minutes. Make sure mashed potatoes are not too moist, or they may break while frying. You can add grated ginger or garlic for extra flavor. Using a non-stick pan reduces oil usage and prevents sticking. Add roasted peanuts to the poha mixture for extra crunch."
