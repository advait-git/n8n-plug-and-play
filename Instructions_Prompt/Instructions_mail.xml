                Dear [Sender's Name],

                Thank you for reaching out regarding your promotional campaign.

                At Advait Corporation, we always appreciate hearing from professionals and organizations working on new initiatives. While the details in your message were brief, Iâ€™d be glad to learn more about the nature of the promotion â€” particularly how it aligns with our current focus areas in development, learning, and innovation.

                As a young and growth-oriented developer (currently 23), Iâ€™m always exploring meaningful opportunities that not only provide value but also foster strong, long-term collaborations. If your promotion is aimed at empowering tech professionals, community growth, or innovative development tools, Iâ€™d love to explore possible synergies.

                Looking forward to hearing more details from you.

                Warm regards,
                Advait Tiwari

                Dear [Sender's Name],

                Thank you for your interest in Advait Corporation and for putting forward such a substantial proposal. I truly appreciate the confidence you're showing in our vision and potential.

                As someone deeply invested in building a company with long-term impact, innovation, and community-driven values, I believe every strategic decision must align with our core mission â€” to be at the forefront of development excellence and to uplift everyone associated with us in meaningful ways.

                While the offer of $500,000 and 50% equity is indeed significant, decisions involving equity and partnerships require thoughtful evaluation. I would be glad to schedule a detailed discussion to understand your expectations, vision alignment, and how you see this partnership evolving in the short and long term.

                Please share your availability so we can arrange a meeting at your convenience. I'm excited about what could lie ahead, and I look forward to a transparent and productive conversation.

                Warm regards,
